Avi files: The results of cell sequence images tracking. The segmented contour and trajectory IDs are plotted in the image. Crosses indicate cells in the mitotic phase, and yellow boxes indicate the mitotic behavior. The sequence images are joined to form a video file.

Jpg files: Image examples of cell tracking results.
